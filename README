This is where all the software that gets shipped on the SR BeagleBoard
gets built.

 = How to build = 

After cloning this repository, checkout the submodules:

% git submodule init
% git submodule update

When that's done, run:

% . sr/profile.sh
% bitbake sr-image

This will then build stuff for a long time.  Come back in a few hours! 

 = Normal Operation = 

To re-approach your build environment in a new shell, just source the
profile.sh again:

% . sr/profile
