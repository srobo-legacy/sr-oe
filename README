This is where all the software that gets shipped on the SR BeagleBoard
gets built.

 = How to build = 

After cloning this repository, run the "checkout" script:

% ./checkout

This will ask you a question.  Answer it.  It'll then checkout the
upstream openembedded tree and bitbake.

When that's done, run:

% . sr/profile.sh
% bitbake sr-image

This will then build stuff for a long time.  Come back in a few hours! 

 = Normal Operation = 

You should only run the "checkout" script once.  To re-approach your
build environment in a new shell, just source the profile.sh again:

% . sr/profile
